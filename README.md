# Dragon Invader
 A video game developed in Unity


  This project largely represents an experiment for state machine A.I. that can exist in multiple states at once and, by extension, do multiple actions at once much like walking and talking.


Developed in Unity 2.2018 since January 2020, this project is a raw prototype for a larger work in progress.
